## Design Overview

The purpose of this vis was to allow a viewer to get a high level overview of trends and correlations of weather data for each city. Viewers can easily compare trends across cities by filtering which cities to show. Each of the graphs are plotted overtime to allow viewers to see trends in data. Viewers can also change their view of a city by switching to weekly or monthly weather views if daily plots provide too much noise. Data points are separated into individual graphs to allow for easier viewing and comparision between cities and between other graphs. Each city is color coded to allow for easy identification of which city is being shown on the graphs.

A few analytical questions that can be asked with this vis are: how does the temperature in a west coast city compare to the temperature in a east coast city? How volatile is the temperature in a city ? How is precipitation correlated with temperature? How hot or cold can a city get?
